## Background

With the advancement of computer architectures and power, together with the related increase in the rate of data generation, new computational methods are required to exploit the vast wealth of available information. In particular, new approaches to classification, as well as new algorithms for modelling and prediction, can be developed through data-driven methods and machine learning. Fuelled by advances in computer science and through the contribution of large companies such as Google and Amazon, these new approaches are making their way into all disciplines of science, including fluid mechanics and turbulence. Despite the potential of these methods, it is essential to be aware of their limitations in order to identify the areas in which they can be applied successfully. Therefore, this Winter School is aimed at providing the participants with an introductory overview of machine-learning methods, including neural networks, reinforcement learning, and uncertainty quantification, applied to problems relevant to engineering and fluid dynamics.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for usage, development and testing purposes. **Please note** that only Linux environments are supported in the current implementation.

First clone this repository by:

```
git clone https://github.com/mrovirasacie/ml19
```

In order to use `ml19` several [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) packages are required. Creating a brand new [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment for this is recommended. This can be done easily with the provided `yml` file as follows:

```
conda create --name ml19 --file ml19_full.yml
conda activate ml19
```

After executing these commands a new Conda environment names `ml19` will be created with all necessary packages. The environment is self-contained so as to not influence other local python installations and avoid conflicts with previously installed packages. To deactivate this environment simply type:

```
conda deactivate
```
